        Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support.
        Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin and contains
        essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or
        minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by
        the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate
        growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours
        that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a
        specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.
        Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food
        in many different ecosystems. Humans generally use cooking to prepare
        food for consumption. The majority of the food energy required is
        supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food through
        intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing
        and food distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture
        relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and
        agricultural systems are one of the major contributors to climate
        change, accounting for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas
        emissions.[1] The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of
        other social and political issues, including sustainability, biological
        diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and food
        security. Food safety and security are monitored by international
        agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, the
        World Resources Institute, the World Food Programme, the Food and
        Agriculture Organization, and the International Food Information
        Council. Definition and classification A typical aquatic food web Food
        is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support and energy to
